# Week 5

In week 5, we continue from the last week and build more concrete features of our application. In week 5, we'll:

- Use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to help handle payments between tenants and hosts.
- Introduce a mutation to have users be able to host listings in the application.
- Finally, leverage [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/), a cloud-based image (and video) management service to store images for new listings on the cloud.

Here is a further breakdown of week 3.
