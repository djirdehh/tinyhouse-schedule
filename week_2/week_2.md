# Week 2

In week 2, we continue from the last week. By the mid of Week 2, we'll find ourselves having the boilerplate of a fully functioning client and server application. In week 2, we'll:

- Create a [React](http://reactjs.org) project with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Introduce and use [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
- Use [Apollo Client](https://apollographql.com/docs/react/) to make our GraphQL requests.
- Finally, use the [Ant Design UI](https://ant.design/) framework to help style our client application.
- Think about the application we would want to build and the features it is to have.
- We'll address and establish routing within the context of our web application.
