# Week 3

In week 3, we continue from the last week and build more concrete features of our application. In week 3, we'll:

- Build the homepage of our application.
- Interact with [Google's Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) to resolve the address/location inputs provided by a user.
- Use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to help handle payments between tenants and hosts.
- Introduce a mutation to have users be able to host listings in the application.
- Finally, leverage [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/), a cloud-based image (and video) management service to store images for new listings on the cloud.
